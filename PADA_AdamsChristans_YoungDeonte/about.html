    A&D Computing was started by Adam Christians and Deonte Young.

We both are compassionate about computing from multiple angles like
hardware and using computers for many types like creating graphic designs,
playing PC Games and getting more familiar with all kinds of unique ways, we
created this site because we wanted to help provide spread our knowledge to
others who might need some assistance in the world of computers and doesnâ€™t
have the same level of knowledge.
