                  High Fantasy RPG

                <p>
                    The high fantasy genre has been used time and time again throughout the history of gaming, and I am here to change that. I believe that high fantasy gaming can be a unique experience every time you turn it on, especially when co-creating said game with a realistic FPS specialist.

                    Realistic FPS
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The genre of Realistic FPS is a very popular go to for most casual gamers these are easy to play and keep you entertained for long periods of time if done corectly. Thats why when we try and make a game that will function as a High Fantasy and Realistic FPS, it will allow those players who want more of a challenge but also want a laid back experience to have a genre for them.
