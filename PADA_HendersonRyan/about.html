			<h2>A bit about us</h2>
			<p>We first opened on July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2003 in the heart of Champaign. Our initial goal was to serve people in the
			Champaign area, helping to fix software issues in their computers. We continued like this for 3 years, until 2006 when we
			expanded our shop to encompass hardware problems as well. Through this expansion, we were able to improve our staff's
			knowledge, as well as diagnose and solve a wider range of problems. We were also the first support business in the area
			to assist with smartphone technology, expanding our company even further. We hope to in the future expand more, continuing
			to lead the industry of device troubleshooting and repair.</p>
			<h2>Our Store</h2>
			<p>We are open every day from 9AM to 9PM, and are located at 612 S Neil Street, Champaign, IL, just across from CVS.</p>
