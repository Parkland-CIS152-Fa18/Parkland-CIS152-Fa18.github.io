        <h3>Flowers on Fifty-Third</h3>
    
            <p class="copy first">Established in 1986 by Sylvia Hill, Flowers on Fifty-Third has been servicing New York City’s 5 boroughs for over 30 years. Sylvia, fresh from rural Alabama, had a passion and a skill for flower arranging and after migrating north to New York City, pursued her dream by opening a florist’s shop on 53<sup>rd</sup> Street and Second Avenue.  Her shop grew from flower arrangements for the home to include services to local businesses and corporate offices in the city.</p>
    
            <p class="copy second">Seeing the dearth of home gardens in the city, Sylvia began offering services and classes to home owners looking to start their own gardens or for help with their maintenance. Thirty years on and Flowers on Fifty Third has grown to include not only the nursery and flower arrangements, but home landscaping. By 2013 Sylvia was retired, but under her granddaughter Tedra, Flowers on Fifty-Third would expand once again, with the help of one intrepid event planner.</p>
    
        <h3>S-Design</h3>
    
            <p class="copy third">Philipa Selwin began S-Design, an event planning company, on a shoestring budget in a little studio above 61<sup>st</sup> and Lex. The company catered to clients short on cash, but big on imagination. Using her 10 years of experience as an interior designer and event planner at a large company, Philipa created for her clients tasteful and thoughtful experiences, limited only by their imagination. For one such event, she hired Flowers on Fifty-Third to decorate and the rest is, as they say, history. </p>
