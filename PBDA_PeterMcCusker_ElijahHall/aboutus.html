<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>So who are we to be telling you how to run?</h2>

	<h2>Elijah Hall</h2>

	<p>Running has been a hobby of mine since the 6th grade but it wasn't until I started running in college that I realized how my ability could help others. Going from middle school running to college competition was an experience full of experiences that transformed me into the runner I am today. With this website I aim to use these experiences that I have gained to further help others not only like myself but also the crowd of people who have little experience or knowledge of running in general.</p>
	
	<h2>Peter McCusker</h2>

	<p>After graduation from high school, I made it my mission to be the best runner that I could be.  I began by training for 5k and 10k races but eventual set my sights on a marathon.  15 marathons later, it is safe to say that I have had my fair share of experience runnning.  I've tried just about every possible combination of workouts for a runner and I've continually expanded my knowledge on the art of running.  I realised throughout my running journey that most people have no idea how to run.  I made it my mission to teach every prospective runner how to run their best and how to meet their goals. </p>
