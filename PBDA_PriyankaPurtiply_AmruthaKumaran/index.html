              <p id="history">Twin City Photography was founded by two friends studying in the photography department at UIUC in 2001. We wanted to create a wonderful service 
			  that offered a variety of high quality prints and other media to the public at reasonable prices. Most of all, we wanted to create a real connection with our 
			  customers and make photoshoots fun, relaxed, and sucessful in capturing their most cherished memories. 17 years on we believe we are fulfilling this mission everyday 
			  with our work and have been changing the way people think about photoshoots all over Champaign-Urbana.</p>
